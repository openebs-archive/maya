Behavior Driven Development(BDD)

Maya makes use of ginkgo & gomega libraries to implement its integration tests.

To run the BDD test:
1) Copy kubeconfig file into path ~/.kube/config or set the KUBECONFIG env.
2) Change the current directory path to test related directory
Example:
To trigger the statefulesets test
Step1: Change the pwd to test directory.
       `cd github.com/openebs/maya/integration-tests/sts/`
Step2: Execute the command `ginkgo -v`

Output:
Sample example output
```
